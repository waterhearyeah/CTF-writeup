Personal learning outcome: 
- For all RE challenges that given executable file, decompile first. 
>Rather than, [dogbolt](https://dogbolt.org/), use [decompiler.com](https://www.decompiler.com/) is better here, cause the file size is big.

|tools|Use Case|
|Dogbolt|File size less than 2MB|
|decompiler.com|Support file types:
- EXE or DLL,
- JAR or CLASS,
- APK,
- XAPK or DEX,
- PYC or PYO,
- LUAC or LUB,
- SMX or AMXX |

- For APK file, look for ```/resources/res/values``` which store files that define values used by an app
>Eg: colour.xml, strings.xml(text display in UI), dimes.xml(margin, padding), styles.xml, array.xml(array of str, int),...
- In CTF case, strings.xml will be focus to find flag.

- When too many file in dir, can use ```grep -rni VALUE``` to find the file/dir that wanna to go next.
>-r: Recursively searches through directories.
>-n: Displays the line number of each match.
>-i: Makes the search case-insensitive.

<ub>Step:<ub>

1. Decompile file and download it.
2. Go to ```/resources/res/values``` and find strings.xml
3. As show in reference video, have many different kind of values folder there, which i think it is just try to trick challenger
>so in other challenge might need to try ur luck or go with the one u think is more tricky and likely to be a flag.
4. In this challenge, the flag is in ```/resources/res/values/strings.xml```

5. Find something that seems like flag and try with diff decoding method, which in here, the flag is in base 32.
