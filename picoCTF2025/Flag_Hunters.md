## From the source code provided

```python
import re #library that working with regular expressions, can search, match, and manipulate strings based on patterns
import time


# Read in flag from file  
flag = open('flag.txt', 'r').read()

secret_intro = \
'''Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
The etherâ€™s ours to conquer, '''\
+ flag + '\n' #From here, learnt that the flag is hidden in this part


song_flag_hunters = secret_intro +\ #This variable need to be triggled 
'''
